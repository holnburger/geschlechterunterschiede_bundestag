  title = {Exploring the {{Political Agenda}} of the {{European Parliament Using}} a {{Dynamic Topic Modeling Approach}}},
  abstract = {This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP) plenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when making plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the committee structure of the Parliament.},

  abstract = {Als vor etwa zwanzig Jahren ein neuartiger Typus rechtspopulistischer Parteien in Westeuropa die politische B\"uhne betrat, war man geneigt, dies als ein kurzfristiges Protestph\"anomen abzutun, das fr\"uher oder sp\"ater wieder verschwinden w\"urde. Inzwischen finden sich solche Parteien in fast allen europ\"aischen L\"andern - auch in den neuen Demokratien Mittelosteuropas. Die meisten von ihnen haben sich in ihren Parteiensystemen dauerhaft etabliert; einige sind dank ihrer St\"arke sogar in die Regierungen gelangt und konnten dadurch unmittelbaren Einfluss auf die politische Agenda nehmen. In Folge dieser Entwicklung hat der Populismus auch auf die Mainstream-Parteien mehr und mehr \"ubergegriffen, die sich den Neuank\"ommlingen in Inhalt und Stil anpassten. Was als elektorale Randerscheinung begann, ist damit zu einer prinzipiellen Herausforderung der Politik und des politischen Systems geworden. Welche Ursachen liegen dem populistischen Protest und der allgemeinen Tendenz einer plebiszit\"aren Transformation der politischen Systeme zugrunde? Handelt es sich beim Populismus um eine richtiggehende Ideologie oder nur um einen mit beliebigen Inhalten kombinierbaren politischen Stil? Wie haben die etablierten politischen Kr\"afte auf die populistische Herausforderung reagiert? Stellen die Populisten eine Gefahr f\"ur die Demokratie dar oder sind sie ein legitimes und sogar n\"utzliches Fr\"uhwarnsystem? Diese Fragen stehen im Mittelpunkt dieses Bandes. Sie werden in einer allgemein-theoretischen Perspektive und im Rahmen von mehreren l\"andervergleichenden Beitr\"agen untersucht.},

  abstract = {Although past research has noted the importance of both power and gender for understanding volubility\textemdash{}the total amount of time spent talking\textemdash{}in organizations, to date, identifying the unique contributions of power and gender to volubility has been somewhat elusive. Using both naturalistic data sets and experiments, the present studies indicate that while power has a strong, positive effect on volubility for men, no such effect exists for women. Study 1 uses archival data to examine the relationship between the relative power of United States senators and their talking behavior on the Senate floor. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between power and volubility for male senators, but a non-significant relationship for female senators. Study 2 replicates this effect in an experimental setting by priming the concept of power and shows that though men primed with power talk more, women show no effect of power on volubility. Mediation analyses indicate that this difference is explained by women's concern that being highly voluble will result in negative consequences (i.e., backlash). Study 3 shows that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others\textemdash{}an effect that is observed among both male and female perceivers. Implications for the literatures on volubility, power, and previous studies of backlash are discussed.},

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence from varied research paradigms substantiates that these consequences occur, especially in situations that heighten perceptions of incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles.},

This role comes amongst others about through a scrutiny of parliamentary norms, rules, conventions, processes, practices, and behaviours. The fundamental premise is that parliaments are 'gendered institutions', that these norms, rules, conventions, processes, practices, and behaviours within parliaments have a gendered nature. The idea that institutions are gendered implies that they are not gender neutral, but produce and reproduce the gender order prevailing in society, in the advantage of men and at the detriment of women (Mackay 2011; Mackay and Meier 2003). This paper reflects on how parliaments produce and reproduce the existing gender order and discusses the concept of a gender-sensitive parliament.},

The aim is to underpin empirically \textendash{} or to test empirically \textendash{} the assertion that female politicians, to a greater extent than male politicians, represent the interests of women. The concept of women's interests divides, on a theoretical level, into three components: the recognition of women as a social category; acknowledgement of the unequal balance of power between the sexes; and the occurrence of policies to increase the autonomy of female citizens. On the empirical level this corresponds to measurements indicating female versus male MPs' attitudes and behaviour in areas such as gender equality and social welfare policy. The data used are parliamentary survey studies from 1985, 1988, and 1994. The analysis controls for effects of politicians' gender when other factors \textendash{} e.g. party affiliation, age, education, and parliamentary experience \textendash{} are taken into account. The main result is that the theory of the politics of presence gains strong empirical support. What this study contributes is a significant measure of stability for the feminist critique of more established theories of representative democracy.},

Second, in some systems, backbenchers will receive less time on the floor as their ideological distance to the party leadership increases. This leads to speeches that do not reflect true party cohesion. Where party reputation matters less for reelection, leaders allow dissidents to express their views on the floor. We demonstrate the implications of our model for different political systems and present evidence using speech data from Germany and the United Kingdom.},

Drawing on the role incongruity theory, we hypothesise that women take the parliamentary floor less often because of the gender stereotypes that are likely to guide the behaviour of party representatives. Such underrepresentation is less likely to be present when debates are dealing with policy areas that can be characterised as feminine. By referring to critical mass theory, we expect women to participate less in debates if they are members of parties with fewer female representatives. The results of an analysis of speechmaking among members of parliament in seven European countries show that female members of parliament are less represented in legislative debates, especially when debates deal with topics that can be characterised as masculine. Furthermore, the effect of gender on speechmaking clearly varies across parties. However, the pattern does not follow the logic derived from critical mass theory. Instead, female members of parliament take the floor less often when they are members of parties with many female representatives.},

  abstract = {Legislative speeches are an important instrument for parties and members of parliament (MPs) to signal their positions and priorities. This raises the question of who speaks when. We evaluate whether a MP's presence on the floor depends on his or her gender. We hypothesize that female MPs give in general less speeches in parliament and that this pattern results from debates dealing with "harder" policy issues. Our expectations are supported when analyzing a new data set containing information on the number and content of speeches given in the Swedish Riksdag between 2002 and 2010.},
