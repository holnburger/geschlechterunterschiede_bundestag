  title = {Exploring the {{Political Agenda}} of the {{European Parliament Using}} a {{Dynamic Topic Modeling Approach}}},
  abstract = {This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP) plenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when making plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the committee structure of the Parliament.},

  abstract = {Als vor etwa zwanzig Jahren ein neuartiger Typus rechtspopulistischer Parteien in Westeuropa die politische B\"uhne betrat, war man geneigt, dies als ein kurzfristiges Protestph\"anomen abzutun, das fr\"uher oder sp\"ater wieder verschwinden w\"urde. Inzwischen finden sich solche Parteien in fast allen europ\"aischen L\"andern - auch in den neuen Demokratien Mittelosteuropas. Die meisten von ihnen haben sich in ihren Parteiensystemen dauerhaft etabliert; einige sind dank ihrer St\"arke sogar in die Regierungen gelangt und konnten dadurch unmittelbaren Einfluss auf die politische Agenda nehmen. In Folge dieser Entwicklung hat der Populismus auch auf die Mainstream-Parteien mehr und mehr \"ubergegriffen, die sich den Neuank\"ommlingen in Inhalt und Stil anpassten. Was als elektorale Randerscheinung begann, ist damit zu einer prinzipiellen Herausforderung der Politik und des politischen Systems geworden. Welche Ursachen liegen dem populistischen Protest und der allgemeinen Tendenz einer plebiszit\"aren Transformation der politischen Systeme zugrunde? Handelt es sich beim Populismus um eine richtiggehende Ideologie oder nur um einen mit beliebigen Inhalten kombinierbaren politischen Stil? Wie haben die etablierten politischen Kr\"afte auf die populistische Herausforderung reagiert? Stellen die Populisten eine Gefahr f\"ur die Demokratie dar oder sind sie ein legitimes und sogar n\"utzliches Fr\"uhwarnsystem? Diese Fragen stehen im Mittelpunkt dieses Bandes. Sie werden in einer allgemein-theoretischen Perspektive und im Rahmen von mehreren l\"andervergleichenden Beitr\"agen untersucht.},

  abstract = {Although past research has noted the importance of both power and gender for understanding volubility\textemdash{}the total amount of time spent talking\textemdash{}in organizations, to date, identifying the unique contributions of power and gender to volubility has been somewhat elusive. Using both naturalistic data sets and experiments, the present studies indicate that while power has a strong, positive effect on volubility for men, no such effect exists for women. Study 1 uses archival data to examine the relationship between the relative power of United States senators and their talking behavior on the Senate floor. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between power and volubility for male senators, but a non-significant relationship for female senators. Study 2 replicates this effect in an experimental setting by priming the concept of power and shows that though men primed with power talk more, women show no effect of power on volubility. Mediation analyses indicate that this difference is explained by women's concern that being highly voluble will result in negative consequences (i.e., backlash). Study 3 shows that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others\textemdash{}an effect that is observed among both male and female perceivers. Implications for the literatures on volubility, power, and previous studies of backlash are discussed.},

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence from varied research paradigms substantiates that these consequences occur, especially in situations that heighten perceptions of incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles.},

This role comes amongst others about through a scrutiny of parliamentary norms, rules, conventions, processes, practices, and behaviours. The fundamental premise is that parliaments are 'gendered institutions', that these norms, rules, conventions, processes, practices, and behaviours within parliaments have a gendered nature. The idea that institutions are gendered implies that they are not gender neutral, but produce and reproduce the gender order prevailing in society, in the advantage of men and at the detriment of women (Mackay 2011; Mackay and Meier 2003). This paper reflects on how parliaments produce and reproduce the existing gender order and discusses the concept of a gender-sensitive parliament.},

The aim is to underpin empirically \textendash{} or to test empirically \textendash{} the assertion that female politicians, to a greater extent than male politicians, represent the interests of women. The concept of women's interests divides, on a theoretical level, into three components: the recognition of women as a social category; acknowledgement of the unequal balance of power between the sexes; and the occurrence of policies to increase the autonomy of female citizens. On the empirical level this corresponds to measurements indicating female versus male MPs' attitudes and behaviour in areas such as gender equality and social welfare policy. The data used are parliamentary survey studies from 1985, 1988, and 1994. The analysis controls for effects of politicians' gender when other factors \textendash{} e.g. party affiliation, age, education, and parliamentary experience \textendash{} are taken into account. The main result is that the theory of the politics of presence gains strong empirical support. What this study contributes is a significant measure of stability for the feminist critique of more established theories of representative democracy.},

Second, in some systems, backbenchers will receive less time on the floor as their ideological distance to the party leadership increases. This leads to speeches that do not reflect true party cohesion. Where party reputation matters less for reelection, leaders allow dissidents to express their views on the floor. We demonstrate the implications of our model for different political systems and present evidence using speech data from Germany and the United Kingdom.},

Drawing on the role incongruity theory, we hypothesise that women take the parliamentary floor less often because of the gender stereotypes that are likely to guide the behaviour of party representatives. Such underrepresentation is less likely to be present when debates are dealing with policy areas that can be characterised as feminine. By referring to critical mass theory, we expect women to participate less in debates if they are members of parties with fewer female representatives. The results of an analysis of speechmaking among members of parliament in seven European countries show that female members of parliament are less represented in legislative debates, especially when debates deal with topics that can be characterised as masculine. Furthermore, the effect of gender on speechmaking clearly varies across parties. However, the pattern does not follow the logic derived from critical mass theory. Instead, female members of parliament take the floor less often when they are members of parties with many female representatives.},

We evaluate whether a MP's presence on the floor depends on his or her gender. We hypothesize that female MPs give in general less speeches in parliament and that this pattern results from debates dealing with "harder" policy issues. Our expectations are supported when analyzing a new data set containing information on the number and content of speeches given in the Swedish Riksdag between 2002 and 2010.},

In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).},

Since the beginning of the 10th electoral term (1983), the Bundestag has allocated speech time to the parliamentary parties (or groups) using a system which has since proven its worth and is applied in most debates: the "Bonn hour" which became later the "Berlin hour". In this system, the total length of a debate is first determined based on a calculation unit agreed by the parliamentary groups at the beginning of each electoral term. This unit, known as an "hour", is generally somewhat longer than 60 minutes, currently 62. The total speaking time, e.g. two "Berlin hours", is then divided up amongst the parliamentary groups using a formula which is also agreed upon at the beginning of each electoral term. MPs who are not affiliated with a parliamentary group are allocated separate times. The formula is based on the relative strengths of the parliamentary groups. However, it also takes other factors into consideration, for example a bonus for smaller parliamentary groups, extra time for the opposition and also for the parliamentary groups supporting the government, since speeches made by the government in the debate count towards their speaking time.]},

Retrospective estimation of these positions in past party systems will require a method for estimating policy positions from political texts. Previous hand-coding content analysis schemes deal with policy emphasis rather than policy positions. We propose a new hand-coding scheme for policy positions, together with a new English language computer-coding scheme that is compatible with this. We apply both schemes to party manifestos from Britain and Ireland in 1992 and 1997 and cross validate the resulting estimates with those derived from quite independent expert surveys and with previous manifesto analyses. There is a high degree of cross validation between coding methods, including computer coding. This implies that it is indeed possible to use computer-coded content analysis to derive reliable and valid estimates of policy positions from political texts. This will allow vast volumes of text to be coded, including texts generated by individuals and other internal party actors, allowing the empirical elaboration of dynamic rather than static models of party competition that move beyond the unitary actor assumption.]},

Since 2009 the project's costly and time-intensive procedure of collecting and coding documents has been fully digitized. As a result, it now provides more than 1800 machine readable documents from 40 different countries. Six hundred of these documents contain content-analyzed annotations at the level of single (quasi-) sentences, which correspond to the Manifesto Project coding scheme. Additionally, the corpus will continually be extended by incorporating new elections and digitizing older documents. The database also provides meta-information for each document (eg. party, election, language, etc.) that allow it to be referenced back to the Manifesto Dataset. The corpus is stored in a standardized format in an online database, and an API and R package (manifestoR) guarantee easy access.},

We present a procedure for collecting fine-grained sentiment scores through crowdcoding to build a negative sentiment dictionary in a language and for a domain of choice. The dictionary enables the analysis of large text corpora that resource-intensive hand-coding struggles to cope with. We calculate the tonality of sentences from dictionary words and we validate these estimates with results from manual coding. The results show that the crowdbased dictionary provides efficient and valid measurement of sentiment. Empirical examples illustrate its use by analyzing the tonality of party statements and media reports.},

The development of this humanitarian crisis are the topic of discussions throughout Europe and covered by media on a daily basis. Germany in particular has been the focus of migration. Over time, in Germany and the neighboring German speaking countries a shift could be observed, from the initial hospitable Willkommenskultur (welcome culture), to more reserved and skeptical points of view. These factors - Germany as the prime-destination for migrants, as well as a shift in public perception and media coverage - are the motivation for our analysis. The current article investigates the coverage of this crisis on traditional and social media, employing sentiment analysis to detect tendencies and relates these to real-world events. To this end, sentiment analysis was applied to textual documents of a data-set collected from relevant and highly circulated German, Austrian and Swiss traditional media sources and from social media in the course of six months from October 2015 to March of 2016.},

More specifically, the study tests whether He occurs more often and in more positive semantic contexts than She, as well as whether She is associated with more stereotypically and essential labels than He is. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) was applied to 400 000 Reuters' news messages, written in English, published in 1996\textendash{}1997. LSA is a completely data-driven method, extracting statistics of words from how they are used throughout a corpus. As such, no human coders are involved in the assessment of how pronouns occur in their contexts. The results showed that He pronouns were about 9 times more frequent than She pronouns. In addition, the semantic contexts of He were more positive than the contexts of She. Moreover, words associated with She-contexts included more words denoting gender, and were more homogeneous than the words associated with He-contexts. Altogether, these results indicate that men are represented as the norm in these media. Since these news messages are distributed on a daily basis all over the world, in printed newspapers, and on the internet, it seems likely that this presentation maintains, and reinforces prevalent gender stereotypes, hence contributing to gender inequities.},

  abstract = {Ebenso wie die Computerunterst\"utzung bei Befragungen (CATI und CAPI) hat der Computer auch bei der Durchf\"uhrung von Inhaltsanalysen Einzug erhalten. Dies f\"uhrte dazu, dass der Begriff der computerunterst\"utzten Inhaltsanalyse strenggenommen auf so gut wie jede heutzutage durchgef\"uhrte (quantitative) Inhaltsanalyse zutreffen d\"urfte, da etwa Codierer die Daten direkt am PC eingeben. Im folgenden Kapitel wird auch auf Varianten der Inhaltsanalyse eingegangen, bei denen der Computer eine deutlich wichtigere Rolle spielt, da ihm die Aufgabe des Codierens \"ubertragen wird. Solche Varianten werden auch als computergest\"utzte oder automatisierte Inhaltsanalyse bezeichnet (vgl. hierzu und als \"Uberblick \"uber unterschiedliche Verfahren Scharkow 2010, 2012). Wir verwenden in der Folge den Begriff der automatisierten Inhaltsanalyse (AIA). Darunter lassen sich eine Reihe sehr unterschiedlicher Verfahren subsumieren. Wir werden im Folgenden etwas genauer auf solche Verfahren eingehen, bei denen der Computer nach einzelnen Worten sucht, diese Worte in ihrem Umfeld darstellt oder Texte anhand von vorab erstellten W\"orterb\"uchern analysiert. Ausgeblendet werden dagegen Verfahren, die Texte daraufhin untersuchen, welche Worte h\"aufig gemeinsam vorkommen und auf Basis von \"Ahnlichkeits- bzw. Distanzmatrizen Gruppen solcher W\"orter bilden.},
